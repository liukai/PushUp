\section{Summary and Concusion\\}

In this paper we examined an event-based scalable long polling server PushUp.
As a dedicated long polling server, the aims of the PushUp is to be efficiently
handle large number of concurrent connections and provides general long 
polling services for different backend web servers.

We compared the PushUp server's performance with other event notification 
models.  The experimental results showed that PushUp server works very 
well in reducing the netowrk traffic, memroy usage, latency, etc. To 
promote the scalablity one PushUp Server, we also extened the single 
machine to several machine.
