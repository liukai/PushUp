\subsection{Reactor Model\\}
The PushUp Server runs atop of the Twisted framework\cite{Twisted}, which is a event-based network programming framework. The highlight of the Twisted is its reactor model\cite{Reactor}.

The reactor is the core of the event loop inside the framework. Event loop is a higher level abstraction of multiplexing model in Linux/Unix (kqueue in Unix and epoll in Linux).

The responsiblities of a event loop is to wait for and dispatches incoming ``events", which will trigger the internal or external "event handlers"(named ``Deferred" in twisted framework, which can be understood as the advanced ``callback" function).

The event loop runs in a single thread and its workflow loop is illustrated in Figure\ref{fig:eventloop}.
