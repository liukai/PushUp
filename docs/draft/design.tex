\section {Design and Implementation\\}

\subsection{Reactor Model\\}
The PushUp Server runs atop of the Twisted framework\cite{Twisted}, which 
adopts the reactor model\cite{Reactor} to enable event-driven mechanism.

The reactor manages how to register handlers for particular event types, and 
how to activate event handlers as events occur within a single thread. 
Moreover the reactor can manages multiple event-loops without introducing 
additional threads. 

Figure \ref{fig:eventloop} demonstrates the how the execution switches
between the event loops and user code. Figure \ref{fig:eventloop_flow} 
further illustrates the detailed work flow.

The reactor has well encapsulated the operating systems' underlying 
event notification mechanism (normally it is kqueue() in Unix and 
epoll() in Linux) and presents a convenient programming interface
for the developers.
