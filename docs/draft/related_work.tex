Some stuff mentioned in the class.

\subsection{Server Push technologies\\}

In \cite{Engin}, Bozdag \emph{et al} provided a complete comparison 
and evaluation of different server push technologies, including the 
HTTP pull, Flash XML socket, Java RMI, etc. As a conclusion the authors 
stated that "an event-driven model on the server side is necessary" 
owing to its , lower consumption of the computing resource, less network
traffic etc.

Another paper \cite{duquennoy09consistency} performs the quantitative 
analysis of the consistency and scalability of several different server
push technologies. As the experimental results showed the event-driven
long polling model shows an excellent efficiency and scalability.
