\section {Overview}
\subsection{Design Goals and Rationale}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Large active connection}  
    As the long polling technologies requires the server to keep the polliing request active for a period of time,
    large number of concurrent clients will generate lots of active connections. One of our goal is to minimize the 
    cost of maintaining these active connections, which could in turn enhance the system's scalability.
     by the degree
    in which a client can be served by different servers without affecting the results [48].
    Scalability is the main issue in a Push model. Web servers usually create a thread per
    client (connection). Libraries such as Java NIO [62] can achieve a thread per request,
    instead of per connection. However, an HTTP based AJAX push solution will have an
    outstanding request waiting on the server which will be used to send a response to the
    client the instant an asynchronous event occurs. This however will break the ”thread
    per request” model. Better technologies are needed on the server side, in order to serve
    a growing number of client requests.
\item {\bf Transparancy: two folds} 
\item {\bf Generality} 
\end{itemize}
