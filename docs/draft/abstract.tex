The ``long-polling" is a server push technology that makes the delivery the 
latest updates from server to client more ``instant". With long polling, 
when a client requests updates from the server, the server
will keep the request connection open if there is no available update yet. 
The server sends the complete response to the client only when the interested
information becomes available or after a suitable timeout.

However this solution may require the server to hold large number of open 
connections for in the server side. To efficiently manage these connections
and reduce the complexity of web development, we proposed an event-driven, 
dedicated long-polling server to provide efficient and scalable long polling
services for the underlying web servers. To prove its efficiency, we compare
the performance of PushUp server and several other server-side event 
notification methods. The experimental results confirms the PushUp server's 
excellent capacity in serving large number of concurrent connections with 
much less resource.
