 The long-polling is a server push technology that makes the delivery the 
 latest updates from server to client more ``instant".

With long polling, when a client requests updates from the server, the server
will hold the request if there is no available update yet. The server sends
the complete response to the server only when the information becomes available
or after a suitable timeout.

However this solution may require the server to hold large number of open 
connections for on the server side. To efficiently manage these connections
and reduce the complexity of web development, we proposed an event-based, 
dedicated long-polling server to provide efficient and scalable long polling
services for the underlying web servers.
