The ``long-polling" is a server push technology that makes the delivery of the 
latest updates from server to clients more ``instant". With long polling, 
when a client requests updated information from the server, the server
will keep the request connection open if there is no available information yet. 
The server sends the complete response to the client only when the interested
information becomes available or after a suitable timeout.

However this solution may require the server to hold large number of open 
connections for in the server side. To efficiently manage these connections
and reduce the complexity of web development, we propose an event-driven, 
dedicated long-polling server to provide efficient and scalable long polling
services for the web servers. To prove its efficiency, we compare
the performance of PushUp server and several other server-side event 
notification methods. The experimental results confirms the PushUp server's 
excellent capacity in serving large number of concurrent connections with 
much less resource.
