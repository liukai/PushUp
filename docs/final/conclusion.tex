\section{Summary and Concusion\\}

In this paper we examined an event-driven scalable long polling server PushUp.
As a dedicated long polling server, the aim of the PushUp is to efficiently
handle large number of concurrent connections and provides general long 
polling services for different backend web servers.

We compared the PushUp server's performance with other event notification 
models. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent capabilities of 
PushUp server in terms of significantly reduced network traffic, lower memory 
usage, slowly growing latency (as the number of concurrent connections gets 
larger), etc. To further evaluate the scalability the PushUp Server, we also
tested the performance of several collaborating PushUp servers, whose 
experimental results shows that PushUp servers scale well as the numbers of
server increases.
