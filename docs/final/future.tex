\section{Future Work}

The current implementation of PushUp Server is a working prototype which illustrates
the ideas of a scalable event driven long polling server. There are several aspects that
we have not addressed in terms of system reliability and fault tolerance. Push Up servers
are actually inherently replicated, the data written in any message queue will be propagated
to the other servers. This means that as long as there is at least 1 PushUp server running
service can still be delivered. In future works, we can tackle the problem of efficiently
restoring state when a PushUp server restarts.
